Let me answer: The key application is data fusion. We need to process all the data into the same format. 

I.e. it can be compact point clouds representation using AI&neural networks, it can be regression task (for localization), it can be segmentation.

Yes, in addition to these mentioned by Ivan we also have all the topics related to visual localization, with keypoint detector and descriptor learning, neural matchers for data association, semantics and object classification. For point clouds we have feature extraction, alignment methods (enhanced by AI in various forms), uncertainty prediction, etc.
I did not elaborate much on those topics, since we were just discussing the general lines.
